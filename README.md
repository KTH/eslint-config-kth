# eslint-config-kth

## Start using this config

In our standard projects your .eslintrc file will only need to contain the following:

```
{
  "extends": ["@kth/eslint-config-kth"]
}
```

All configuration needed will come from this config.

## Developer

Our goal with this module is to use the same ESLint config in all our node projects at KTH.

This means we all are responsible for keeping this module fresh and helping us in our daily work.

DonÂ´t be afraid to make changes but also take your time to discuss with colleagues about the changes you want to make.

**This module/package is built and published to NPM automatically after push.**
